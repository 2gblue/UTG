# UMPSA TTG (Timetable Generator)

**Final Year Project** (FYP) that is made during my final year of study in _Universiti Malaysia Pahang Al-Sultan Abdullah_ (UMPSA) in 2024. The project aims to automate timetable generation process during study/semester planning, usage in accordance with the **Open Registration** of the university. The project aims to complement the ever-changing selections of desired subjects due to the hectic nature of vacancy between different subjects during the registration period.
